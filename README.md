# Computer_Architecture


This repository contains all the source files as well as some brief descriptions regarding 
a project for the Computer Architectures course, led in Politecnico di Torino university. 
In particular, a solution for two past exams had to be written in three assembly languages:
8086 assembly, x64 assembly, 32 and 64-bits ARM assembly. 
In order to run 8086 assembly programs, emu8086 microprocessor emulator was used, as well as MASM, 
used in association with DOSBox 0.74; for ARM assembly files, instead, a Raspberry Pi 3, model B, 
board was used, with a 64-bits OS. All the informations on how to get everything working can be 
found inside the various folders. x64 programs have been run on Linux, using NASM.
